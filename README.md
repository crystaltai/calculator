## Summary

### What I learned

- Used loop to add event listeners to all buttons of a certain class
- Used an object to hold the user's inputs (first number, second number, operator) so that code is organized in a more succinct way (versus floating variables); the same method was used to organize the operator methods as well
- The biggest learning takeaway was understanding the current state of the calculator. For example, if it was currently waiting for user to input the first number (vs the second number).
  - This impacts the calculator logic, so it doesn't allow the calculator to run without all required inputs
  - This also impacts the calculator display to ensure it is reset (cleared) for each input number
